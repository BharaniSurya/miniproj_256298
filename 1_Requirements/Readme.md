# Requirements
## Introduction
 --- In this busy world we some management systems to store our data which we require normally and also which cannot be all remembered either.We have been using records to write down the data which is takes up space and require hardwork to record it properly.Instead we can use this mangement systems to store the data and update it with ease . Also one of the major disadvantage of those written Records is that we cannot update it properly. Here , car service management will be implemented so that the service agency can easily manage the data and 
 be never forget a service or informing the client about the completed service car which the customer has to pickup.
 ---This topic was chosen to show my skills in c programming about using the important features and to learn to implement in a professional way to make sure about the working ,efficiency,
time complexity and resource management.  

## Research
-- What can this system do?
     As a customer we can easily blame that service is bad but no company wants to give a bad service or hold back our car for no reason .The only reason would be that they had many work 
where they forgot your case or some other confusion in who has to take care of those is not properly assigned in service. So to take care of this problem we use this management to take care 
of the data and be updated to make the customer and the service company happy and satisified.

Advantages if using the management system?
     By using this management system we dont require lots of Record where we use to search for the customer information and it can easily update the information and use it to the advantage 
of the customers to provide the promised service.Also the process will be ease because serviceman can easily visualize the work.

How can we improvise it in future?
     The management system can be extended in any direction , one of possible and useful area is where we use cloud to store the data rather than in a single computer and create a UI for
the customers to view the process going on the car and alert automatically to the customer to pickup the vehicle after the completion of the service.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
### s:
   makes easy to maintain a record.
   updation of the records are simple.

   if there is some system crash ,all the data would be lost forever.
### o:
    can be integrated with the cloud to be accessed from any computer.
   it can be made into an app where even the customer can see the progress
### t:
    unlike book records if someone manipulates with tha data it is hard to find out.
